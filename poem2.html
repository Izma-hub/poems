            <p>
                By day the bat is cousin to the mouse. <br>
                He likes the attic of an aging house. <br><br>
    
                His fingers make a hat about his head. <br>
                His pulse beat is so slow we think him dead. <br><br>
    
                He loops in crazy figures half the night <br>
                Among the trees that face the corner light. <br><br>
                
                But <span class="highlight"></span> when he brushes up against a screen, <br>
                We are afraid of what our eyes have seen: <br> <br>
                
                For something is amiss or out of place <br>
                When mice with wings can wear a human face.  <br>
